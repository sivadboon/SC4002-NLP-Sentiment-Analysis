This project explores various deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis, optimizing word embeddings and RNN-based models to improve classification accuracy.

Overview
This project implements word embeddings (GloVe, FastText) and deep learning models (RNN, BiLSTM, CNN, Attention) to classify sentiment in movie reviews. The models are benchmarked on test accuracy, with the best-performing architecture achieving 81.05% accuracy using a BiLSTM + BERT + Attention model.

Features
Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words using FastText.
Word Embeddings: Comparison of GloVe and FastText embeddings for feature representation.
Deep Learning Models:
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
BiLSTM & BiGRU (Bidirectional LSTM/GRU)
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
BERT + Attention Mechanism
Hyperparameter Optimization: GridSearch used to fine-tune learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures.
Evaluation Metrics: Test accuracy, precision-recall, confusion matrix
